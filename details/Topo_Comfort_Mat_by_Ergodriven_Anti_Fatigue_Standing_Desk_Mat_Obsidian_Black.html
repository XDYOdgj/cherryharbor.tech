I bought a sitting/standing desk, but didn't stand that much because my feet would get sore. I bought the Topo Comfort Mat and it has made so much difference. I teach in my socks and the mat feels so good under my feet--squishy-firm. I love the ridges around the edges and the hill in the middle. I move a lot as I teach and I can always find a ridge or a hill where I need it to make my feet feel good. I am very happy with the mat. I've been using it for a couple of months, now, and it's holding up just fine. I'm hoping it will last me years.",

			var commentsList = [{"user":"Lolli","content":"This mat is a dream come true and I've been telling all my friends about it so I figured it was worthy of a 5-star review.I am a dancer but I also work and game at a standing desk, so it's great being able to stretch and manipulate my feet when I'm between sessions. This is so much better than just standing around in sneakers or on a traditional mat. Being able to do that coveted stair-lift stretch brings joy to my dancer heart and relieves sore feet so much more efficiently than traditional floor stretching. The edges and the little ball in the middle have just the right amount of squishy resistance that my feet need to stay flexible and it's also great if you find you're a fidgety person that struggles standing in one spot for too long. I can stand on this thing for hours without getting foot fatigue. I will be requesting one of these at all my workplaces.I try to only buy things on Amazon that I'll plan to use over a long period of time because I care deeply about our planet and don't want to add to the growing mountains of waste in our landfills and oceans. I'm not disappointed with the quality of the materials or the thickness and can see this thing lasting a very very long time.I rarely write these kinds of reviews so if I'm here writing this - trust me. It's a good product. The only downside is that it costs so much to ship to New Zealand, and I was worried about the value before it arrived. I'm so happy with it and it was well worth the expense.I can see other ways these types of mats can be useful (particularly for VR gaming) so if the manufacturer is willing to listen, I'd love to spit ball some ideas.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-25 19:59:03"},{"user":"WHy gEoff","content":"I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and weigh 330 pounds. I recently invested in a standing desk to help reduce my sedentary habits, shed some extra weight, and get back into shape. I experience foot pain quite often, including plantar fasciitis, so I decided to try the Non-Flat Anti-Fatigue Mat, hoping it would help me stretch and exercise my feet. This mat has far exceeded my expectations.Unmatched Foot Comfort and ReliefStanding barefoot on the Non-Flat Anti-Fatigue Mat has been a revelation. The various surfaces allow me to massage my feet all day long. The textured areas and different angles are perfect for stretching my toes forward and backward, giving me a great range of motion that I didn\u2019t have before. My feet, which usually ache after long days, actually feel less painful now, despite standing all day.Full-Body EngagementI\u2019ve found myself using the mat for much more than just standing. I use the back edge to stretch my calves, often standing on the balls of my feet and lowering myself down to deepen the stretch. The mat\u2019s design also lets me do calf raises throughout the day, keeping my legs active and engaged.Perfect for Asian SquatsOne of the unexpected benefits of this mat is how well it supports me during Asian (resting) squats. I can comfortably squat for 5-10 minutes at a time while working, with the mat providing the stability I need. This is something I never thought I\u2019d be able to do for extended periods.Productivity BoostI struggle with narcolepsy, and staying awake, alert, and productive throughout the day has always been a challenge, especially during meetings. Since I started using the Non-Flat Anti-Fatigue Mat, my productivity has skyrocketed. Standing helps me stay far more awake and engaged, and this mat allows me to stand much longer without discomfort. It\u2019s been a game-changer for maintaining focus and energy during my long 12-hour shifts.12-Hour Shifts, All Day StandingI work long shifts\u2014often 12 hours at my desk. I initially thought I\u2019d stand for just a few hours each day and sit for the rest. However, this mat has made it so comfortable that I now stand all day long. Despite the long hours, my feet feel better than they have in a long time, and my overall posture has improved.Final ThoughtsAfter only a few weeks of use, I can confidently say that the Non-Flat Anti-Fatigue Mat has been a game-changer for my workday, my foot health, and my productivity. If you\u2019re looking to stand for work, this mat is a must-have!","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-20 19:59:03"},{"user":"anonymous","content":"As a standing desk worker, I always experienced the problem of tired feet. That\u2019s not until I heard of the comfort mats. Not sure of what model will work for me, I made up my mind to settle for two mats built with quality and comfort in mind. These are Ergocomfy Not-Flat Anti Fatigue Mat and Topo by Ergodriven Anti-Fatigue Mat. With their new-generation features, these mats have proven to be one of the favorites among standing desk users. Below is a comparison review of the two mats and what they\u2019ve got to offer.Ergocomfy Standing Desk MatThe Ergocomfy mat comes large to provide plenty of room for movement. The mat measures 24 x 36 inches, making it larger than the Topo mat. And considering lack of good blood circulation to be one of the major causes of tired feet, Ergocomfy took this into consideration by sporting two massage sections in this mat. The massage sections help trigger muscle engagement and improve blood circulation. This mat is designed to accommodate at least 10 standing positions, a feature that lets you feel more energized while improving productivity at work.With this mat, you get a calculated terrain feature that motivates you to move more. And it doesn\u2019t disappoint when it comes to quality. This mat is made of quality 100-percent polyurethane foam that\u2019s covered in a pebbled skin. In short, it\u2019s a mattress that\u2019s built to last. What\u2019s more, you also get the convenience of a hands-free edge positioning that lets you slide the mat more conveniently. This mat comes in black - a color that you may find quite handy in concealing any forms of dirt.Topo Standing Desk Anti-Fatigue MatTopo Mat is known for its exceptional quality - a quality that has made it one of the top choices for standing desk users. This is a mat that\u2019s equipped with the next generation features to ensure that you get maximum comfort. Measuring 26 x 29 inches, the mat is spacious enough to provide lots of movement. Healthier standing has been factored in by incorporating a calculated terrain feature on the mat. This feature helps engage the muscles for easy exploring, articulation and stretching. Though it lacks the massage function to provide excellent blood circulation, the mat compensates for this with the cushioned terrain that triggers subconscious movement.The quality of this mat is quite good and compares well to that of Ergocomfy. It\u2019s made of the same foam material - 100% polyurethane. With it, you get the sublime comfort of a durable pebbled skin that covers the mat. The mat slides easily and can even be repositioned with one foot. You get this mat in a range of colors to help match your taste. You can either choose to go for Obsidian black or Altostratus Grey.VerdictAfter drawing comparisons from the two mats, I decided to settle for Ergocomfy Mat over the Topo Mat. This is because the Ergocomfy Mat provides lots of extras. It\u2019s more spacious and has got the most healthy benefits. This is a mat that\u2019ll surely make me more productive as a standing desk user - a job that I really enjoy. And above all, I\u2019m confident that it will last for longer and provide the most benefit for every penny spend.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-02-06 19:59:03"},{"user":"Joho","content":"Ok first with the negatives:It does in fact have a smell. Depending on who you are, the smell can be somewhat overwhelming. It smells like plastic and warehouse. What I ended up doing was covering a large t-shirt with some deodorizing spray and then wrapped the shirt around the entire mat. It wraps it with some effort and allows for bare-foot standing without coating your feet in gross smells. I used an old, clean, men's black shirt to match.Now the positives:It works amazingly for standing desks. The ridges around the outside provide great support for your feet and allow you to flex your ankle and toes. The tear-drop in the center is absolutely wonderful on the arches. I've stood for hours and this thing is so plush yet sturdy that I feel minimal wear on my calves. The entire back part is great for stretches. Even the flat part of the mat is leagues above standing on hardwood for 2 hours.The quality of build is excellent. It feels like this mat can last a few years of heavy use. I would imagine the teardrop will flatten more and more as I use it, but it does feel like it's built excellently.I would recommend this for anyone with a standing desk or a security job where you stand in one place for long periods. I can imagine using this daily. I'm sure the smell will clear long before the mat falls apart. Then I can remove the t-shirt if necessary.*Note to anyone who wants to use the t-shirt cover; make sure to wash the shirt if you are barefoot. That shirt is gonna smell like rancid vinegar very quickly without proper washing (you know who you are...)It would be great if the manufacturers could maybe store their products with some kind of activated-charcoal smell remover or something similar. That way they will hopefully be less smelly by the time they get sold and shipped.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-01-13 19:59:03"},{"user":"Lee","content":"I've used this mat now daily at my standing desk for many hours straight the past 5 months and I'm very satisified.

I decided because of many back problems from my neck to my lower spine, hips and just overall stiffness all around that I'd move to spending more time with a standing desk than sitting. As I previously said, I stand a lot now. Before this purchase I bought a mat from Walmart for like $40.. also had a anti-fatigue mat I believe was under $40.. neither can compare to this. The $100 is well worth the cost and the design does in fact allow you to change your stance and more or less encourage it than standing in one spot constantly for hours on end. Not standing as much before this, it did take some time for the body to adapt to the prolonged standing unless you're already on your feet all day. I do need limit the sometimes 5-8hrs straight standing and practice alternating 30 minutes standing to sitting. Overall, worth every penny.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-02-27 19:59:03"},{"user":"Randall W. Woods","content":"I'm relatively new to doing the whole stand up desk thing. I've traditionally sat in a chair most of the day for my job. I tried to do the standing desk thing in the past but it didn't take long for my legs to fatigue. I'm also a runner, ultra runner in fact, so you would think my legs could take the stress. Not so much. It wasn't until recently that I decided to try again and this time I researched and bought the Topo anti-fatigue pad. What a difference it makes! I've been using it now for two weeks and it's really made a difference. It only took me a few days because I could easily stand for multiple hours without sitting.I really like the fact that there are multiple options for where to place your seat. You're not supposed to stand in one position too long and by having different places to place your feet, I've already noticed the difference in how my legs feel as I change positions since it changes how your legs are positioned.I really enjoy being able to stretch out my calves on the back of the pad. That has really helped after a long run. I've even noticed a difference in how much stronger my legs feel when I run. I wasn't expecting that at all. I honestly thought my legs would feel more tired but they don't.Although the cost seems like a lot for standing pad, to me it's definitely be worth the cost. So much so that I plan on buying one for the office that was recently converted to standing desks.One final note, I'm 6'2\" 220lbs and this pad fits me just fine. The rubber provides support with some give but doesn't go flat where ever I stand.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-03-11 19:59:03"},{"user":"Nigel","content":"At first I was reluctant to buy this due to the price but after my first full work day standing on it, I get the premium on it. the material is thick and supportive, and the raised portions of it really do keep your feet moving around the mat. I Find my stead stretching my calfs on it all day and moving around in comfort. I can stand hours longer on this without having to fight the urge to sit down like I did when standing on the flat floor. I purchased this to start using my standing desk more as sitting all day has been creating Hip strength and flexibility issues. Very satisfied and understand the hype.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-30 19:59:03"},{"user":"Farmerjaneusa","content":"I can't believe I spent so much to stand on something, but here I am. I've got back issues and months ago I went down a back and foot health youtube rabbit hole and ended up adding this and a few other things to my shopping cart.It took some more time to contemplate what I wanted out of a standing desk and for the right price (I ended up in the podium realm instead and found an adjustable one for under $150 with a lower shelf, and two levels up top). I'm still waiting for that to arrive to get the full effect.I pulled it out of the box and wondered why I spent $100 bucks on a simple piece of plastic... but then I plopped it on the floor and started moving around on it (shoeless). I saw some reviews about it being too hard, but it's not - it's firm but giving. Maybe they updated their material. The last time my feet were that happy was my first pair of slip on breathe-easy Skechers.It's unnatural to just stand stiff for even a few minutes. When I stand washing dishes for 15 minutes I'm fidgeting around, lifting my heels, bending my knees, etc.In the past when I've watched people giving lectures or speeches I wondered how they could just... stand there... like a piece of wood.I'll update if I change my opinion once I get my desk and start standing for long periods of time, but as of now I feel like this is a perfect fit.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-06 19:59:03"},{"user":"Daniel Malone","content":"I stand on my feet all day at work.We have carpet tiles, which are a huge upgrade to the otherwise cement ground.When I got this mat it made the carpet tiles feel like cement.I really enjoy standing in a lunge with my back heel down to stretch my calf. I also really enjoy the ability to wobble on the sides to keep my legs active.I do walk around a fair bit at work, but coming back to the home station of this ergo mat is like a plush hug for my feet.Highly recommend to anyone who stands up for over an hour per day.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-03 19:59:03"},{"user":"Tory Anderson","content":"I teach on-line classes and was sitting for eight hours a day. I bought a sitting/standing desk, but didn't stand that much because my feet would get sore. I bought the Topo Comfort Mat and it has made so much difference. I teach in my socks and the mat feels so good under my feet--squishy-firm. I love the ridges around the edges and the hill in the middle. I move a lot as I teach and I can always find a ridge or a hill where I need it to make my feet feel good. I am very happy with the mat. I've been using it for a couple of months, now, and it's holding up just fine. I'm hoping it will last me years.","purchase_model":"Color: Obsidian Black Color: Obsidian Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-20 19:59:03"}];
